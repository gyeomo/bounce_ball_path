# bounce_ball_path
This is Unity Project. 2D Game


It's made for Android applications.

It is a 2D game.

I wrote in Unity in C #.

The way the game progresses is by pressing the blue ball, dragging it in the desired direction and releasing your hand.

You must go to the target point (red ball) within the specified number of collisions.

You can see where the blue ball is going and how it goes.

This is not a full-fledged release yet, so just press the ad button.
